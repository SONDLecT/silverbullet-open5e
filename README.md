# Import Open5E content into Silverbullet using Space-script and snippetse
Import Open5E content into your Silverbullet notes

[Silverbullet](https://silverbullet.md/) excels as a place to organize your notes as a ttrpg/D&D dungeon master. Being able to link worlds and adventures and players and player characters and monsters and locations – and being able to query between them all – can help the most scatter-brained forever-DM’s among us keep track of our many adventures and all the myriad ways our players run amuck.
[Open5E](https://open5e.com/) is an open source project aiming to provide a usable database and API of open-licensed 5th edition and 5e compatible content.

This in-progress project aims to create a set of space script functions that call Open5E, and accompanying snippets that make it easy to slash-command add spells, monsters, items – whatever – right into your notes. Simply add the space-script codeblocks somewhere in your space and run the sytem:reload command to load the new functions. Use one of the included snippets to easily insert markdown-friendly statblocks, items, spell-descriptions or anything else you can find on Open5E.
